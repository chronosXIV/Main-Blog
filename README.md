# My main tumblr blog: Alumina

I created this blog back in January 2014 and since then it has helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills. In order to learn HTML and CSS first-hand, I used to search for website designs that I found interesting, and alter them to find out more about the code and how it worked. The website link is: http://alumina.tumblr.com/

Some of the things I modified for the current blog:

- Added an audio player on the top left corner that fits the aesthetic of the blog both visually and aurally.
- Due to Tumblr's limitations on image size being either one of 250px, 400px or 500px, the way the original source was coded would display multi-image posts in a vertical format (ie. like a 2x1, 3x1, 4x1 etc. matrix) or give an error if the post size was smaller than 250px. I fixed this problem so now the multi-image will be displayed 1x2, 1x3, 2x2 and so on. This avoids a multi-image post looking very long on the blog page.
- Removed captions.
- Fixed overflowing text.
- Original source had issues where the infinite scroll would get stuck if the webpage did not load fast enough, which I fixed.
- Changed styling choices like the cursor, the favicon, the font type, size and colours, post borders, post backgrounds, blog background, etc.

PS: Alumina is a name for Aluminium Oxide, but it's the name of my blog as it's the title of a song I really like.
